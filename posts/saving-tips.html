                      <p>I think this is one of the more important tips overall. I like to follow the principle of paying yourself first. This principle basically means that you take a percentage of your paycheck and put it into a separate account. The money that you have in the account will gradually build up and will allow you to feel more secure.</p>
                      <p>The percentage that you put into this account should be no less than 10% of your paycheck. If you can afford more then go for it. The principle of 10% comes from the book <a href="https://tidd.ly/3gxDL1Y" target="_blank" rel="sponsored">The Richest Man In Babylon</a> which has several practical rules for building wealth. I think this is a must-read for anyone beginning their financial literacy journey.</p>

                      <h2 class="section-heading">2. Don't buy today</h2>
                      <p>This principle aims to stop impulse buying and keep money in your account. We have all been there, buying something without really thinking about it. There is something about shopping that can make us feel good. There is a dopamine hit which gives the sensation of happiness. This dopamine hit doesn't come from the actual purchase, but the anticipation of the purchase. So when you are shopping online you can put things in your cart but don't go through with it and get the same excitement without actually buying anything.</p>
                      <p>If this is not enough for you try putting everything in your cart but don't process the payment. Come back to your cart a day or two later. Do you still want the items? Leaving time between adding to the cart and the actual checking out can make you realise if you truly want the item or if it was just an impulse buy.</p>
                      <h2 class="section-heading">3. Don't buy as much takeout</h2>
                      <p>Ordering takeout is such a convenience and who doesn't love ordering from their favourite restaurant. The problem with ordering takeout even a couple of times a week is that the cost adds up pretty quickly. The fact is that cooking your own meals can reduce the amount you spend on food overall.</p>
                      <p>This is something that I personally struggle with cutting out because I love the convenience of ordering food. This is one of the areas that I need to improve. Currently, I am spending €50-70 a week on takeout. This adds up to between €2600-3640 a year. As you can see in my case there is the potential for huge savings.</p>
                      <h2 class="section-heading">4. Designate a no spending day</h2>
                      <p>Designate one day a month where you don't spend anything except for your fixed costs. This is a great way to save money. It could mean making food at home, socializing at home or going on a walk, having an evening in rather than going out.</p>
                      <p>Once you are used to this, you could increase the frequency of your no spend days to twice a month or even once a week. Doing this can really increase your monthly savings.</p>
                       <a href="#!"><img class="img-fluid" src="../assets/img/walking.jpeg" alt="How not to spend money" /></a>
                      <h2 class="section-heading">5. Pay in cash or put a limit on your card</h2>
                      <p>Payments have become so much simpler with tap and the ease of paying with a card. This in turn makes us think that those little purchases are not a big deal. When paying with a card there is a degree of separation from your money and it can feel like you aren't really spending money. This separation can cause you to spend more money overall. This is also why banks are constantly trying to make payments easier.</p>
                      <p>One way to stop this separation is to leave your card at home and take cash with you. Doing this will force you to hold onto physical money and it may make you rethink some of your impulse purchases. Carrying around cash is not for everyone, but there is the option on some of the online banks to set limits on your daily/weekly/monthly spending. This way you can force yourself to think more about your purchases.</p>
