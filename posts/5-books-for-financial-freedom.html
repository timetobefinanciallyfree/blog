                            I have included some of the books I have personally read and recommend to anyone starting their financial freedom journey. The books have a range of different perspectives and come at personal finance in different ways. I have linked to <a href="https://tidd.ly/3Ji7VCG" target="_blank" rel="sponsored">The Book Depository</a> for each of the books as they have free worldwide delivery on all books.

                            </p>
                            This is one of my favourite personal finance books. The book is short and covers the basics of how to build wealth and control your finances. The book goes into 7 different rules of money. This is one of the first books I read on my personal finance journey. By applying the principles in this book I was able to get control over my finances and start making better financial decisions. This book made me start saving and stick to it.

                            <p>
                            This is another short book and its concepts are easy to comprehend. This book will help you shift your mindset on money. The book provides real lessons which can be applied to your own finances. This book taught me about my relationship with money and how to improve it.

                            <h2 class="section-heading">3. <a href="https://tidd.ly/3ozX7Ii" target="_blank" rel="sponsored">Think And Grow Rich</a></h2>
                            <p>
                            This book explains 13 principles to follow to accumulate riches. While parts of the book seem outdated, the principles in this book still stand. One thing that this book taught me was about how your mindset can affect how rich you will become. It has shifted my mindset from being negative to more optimistic. The book also goes into detail on how to be a good leader and the common reasons for failure. Many lessons can be learned from reading this book.

                            <h2 class="section-heading">4. <a href="https://tidd.ly/34rmEfS" target="_blank" rel="sponsored">The Millionaire Fastlane</a></h2>
                            <p>
                            This Millionaire Fastlane breaks away from the norm of personal finance books and offers a different perspective. This book is another very easy read and it is broken up into easy to read sections. It describes the different roadmaps to wealth and the only way to get there quickly (within 5 years) is the Fastlane. I learned that the only way to generate wealth quickly is to become a producer or entrepreneur. The book goes into 5 Fastlane commandments which will help you start a business to put you in the Fastlane. This book gave me the push I needed to start this blog and some other projects.

                            <h2 class="section-heading">5. <a href="https://tidd.ly/35OSROz" target="_blank" rel="sponsored">Rich Dad Poor Dad</a></h2>
                            <p>
                            Rich Dad Poor Dad is another absolute must-read; it is packed with incredible financial lessons. This book changed the way I think about wealth. This taught me the difference between how rich and poor people think and use their money. One of my key takeaways from the book was that rich people acquire assets and not liabilities that they think are assets. It taught me the difference between an asset and a liability by looking at how the cash flows. Rich Dad Poor Dad has changed my financial destiny and made me rethink alot of the financial advice I once thought was solid.
