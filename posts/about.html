                        <p>Hi my name is Danny, I am a 20 something software engineer from Ireland who is looking to change my financial situation. I have been working full time for the last three years. While I have a fairly decently salary and benefits package I have found I have found that I don't have very much freedom. I started looking into financial freedom in mid-2021. I started watching a number of different financial advice Youtube channels, listened to podcasts, read books and generally just consumed all the content relating to financial advice and on how to gain financial freedom.</p>
                        <p>One thing which is apparent in all of these types of content is that you need to actually do something to change your path and become financially free. Now the type of person I am is very chilled out and I'll admit it I like to procrastinate. I am not saying I did absolutely nothing to begin the journey I started investing in stocks and Cryptocurrencies. This with the fact that I had fairly healthy savings led me to believe that I was going in the right direction.</p>
                        <p>While investing was definitely a step in the right direction there are so many other bits of advice from the content which I did not take. One of the reasons I am setting up this blog is to pull together some of the advice which I thought was profound or changed the way I thought about my financial situation. I want to try out some of the advice and write about what I found useful, compare different financial tools and products and see which is the best, try out different saving/budgeting methodologies and see what works for me. </p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Why am I so interested in Financial Freedom?</h2>
                        <p>I want to work off my own schedule. For me, freedom is being able to do what you want when you want to. Working in a job where there is limited choice for the type of work and when to accomplish this deflates any sense of freedom.</p>
                        <p>Location freedom is something that I have realised is very important to me. While my Software job technically can be done remotely from anywhere in the world, there are tax implications that mean that I cannot work outside of my country (Ireland). </p>
                        <p>I don't want to exchange time for money. I want to look into creating assets which generate income for me rather than having to exchange my time for money.</p>
                        <p>I want to be able to explore different interests, hobbies and skills and use my time in a more valuable and meaningful way. </p>
                      
                        <p>These are some of the reasons why I have been researching this topic so much. I am looking to break free from the 9-5, live life for me and have the freedom to do what I want. If this sounds interesting to you follow along the journey.</p>
